Working through Black Key Software, I worked a a contractor for NASA at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
in La Canada Flintridge, CA. While working there, I worked to help the transition of internal image
processing tools to the Cloud, AWS. I migrated two systems from running on servers full time when they 
were only used occasionally to being serverless applications. This cut the cloud bill for these 
applications by 90%. As part of this effort, I taught my team and the organization to rethink how 
they thought about architecting their solutions in the cloud.

Due to budget issues with the parent organization sponsoring the project I was working on, JPL was 
not able to renew the contract I was working on for FY22.
