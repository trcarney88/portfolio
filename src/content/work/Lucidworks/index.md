At Lucidworks, I work as a Software Engineer on the Cloud Platform team, we are building the platform
Lucidworks' new SaaS application, [Springboard](https://lucidworks.com/products/connected-search/).
Springboard is a collection of Springboot applications that run on Kubernetes clusters hosted on GCP.
On the platform team, we are responsible for auto scaling compute resources, the core API,
databases, authentication and authorization, etc.
 
Springboard is a Search as a Service Platform. It quickly allows our customers to integrate high
quality machine learning based search into their websites. Springboard is a very new applications
and the whole lucidworks team is working to add new features as we bring this product to market.
