Working through Black Key Software, I worked as a contractor for NASA at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
in La Canada Flintridge, CA. While working there, I worked to help the transition of internal image
processing tools to the Cloud, AWS. I migrated two systems from running on servers full time when they
were only used occasionally to bring serverless applications. This cut the cloud bill for these
applications by 90%. As part of this effort, I taught my team and the organization to rethink how
they thought about architecting their solutions in the cloud.

Due to budget issues with the parent organization sponsoring the project I was working on, JPL was
not able to renew the contract I was working on for FY22.
