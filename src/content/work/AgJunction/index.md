Software Lead for the Polaris Project.  Polaris is the name for the project that will build the software and controls platform for all future projects at Agjunction. The platform is a Yocto Linux based application platform where each process is run in a docker container.</p>

As part of the Polaris project, I oversaw the design and implementation of a docker based micro-services architecture on an embedded device. As part of this effort, I led the creation and completion of software sprints. I was in charge of mapping out a sprint schedule the would make sure the software team hit its goals for the year.</p>

Wrote a low level driver for a Magnetometer to run on a microcontroller. The majority of the driver was written based on the current code and the data sheet. This driver only required minimal integration and test time before the entire system was ready to be tested on a tractor.</p>

Ported an existing feature, a special type of turn, from AgJunction's OEM product to their consumer product. This feature allows the user to be able to automatically do a U-turn at the end of a pass on the field and begin a new pass with the implement behind the tractor lined up perfectly with the previous pass, no overlap. This feature makes the consumer product much more valuable to Agjunction's customers.</p>

Updated production test software of one of AgJunction's products to be more configurable and flexible. The previous implementation of the production test software had every parameter hard coded. These hard coded values no longer worked the the configurations coming from the factory. I made the hard coded parameters flexible and made some changes to the software to make it easier to update version numbers and server names to save time on maintenance in the future.</p>
