- Maintained two seperate code bases for the embedded software of a software defined radio. Due to the sensitive nature of the program their were two diffent sets of software, the real app and a test app that could be used in a more open environment</p>

* Updated a communications receiver built as a Windows application to work with Windows 10. This required the security for the software to be updated to work the TPM 2.0 instead of TPM 1.2. I lead the effort to port our security implementation over to a new library I wrote that used the TPM 2.0</p>

* Made numerous improvement to the production test software of the software defined radio. These improvements included improving our pass rate form 80% to >95%, implementing a test report that made it easier for the test operators to see if and how a unit failed the production test, and increase the test coverage to cover all use cases of the radio.</p>

* Characterized the RF performance of the software defined radio, then performaned detailed data analysis on the resulting data leading to an improved hardware design of the radio. Python, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib were used to perform the data analysis.</p>

* As a Test Engineering intern, I Made improvements to production test software and processes resulting in a cost savings of $200,000 over the life of the contract.</p>

* As a Systems Engineering intern on Rescue-21, Developed a process improvement to save over 20 hours per week in Engineering labor by automating the assignment of trouble tickets
saving the program $125,000 per year.</p>
