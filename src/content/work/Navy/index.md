- Electronics Technician with the following specialties, [Strategic SHF Satellite Communitcations Technician](https://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/an-gsc-52.htm), [TACAN (Tactical Air Navigation) Technician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_air_navigation_system), [CBSP (Commercial Broadband Satellite Program)](https://www.l3harris.com/all-capabilities/commercial-broadband-satellite-program-cbsp).</p>

* As a SATCOM Tech at NCATMS LANT det Rota, Spain (Naval Computer/Telecommunications Area Master Station, Atlantic detachment Rota, Spain) I was in charge of the troubleshooting and maintienance of a multi-million dollar satellite communications system. I was also the head instructor for the SATCOM training program at the command. As part of my other duties, I was the lead watch stander for the duty section (work group) which put me in charge of two other people, often of a higher rank than myself. I was awarded a Flag Letter of Commendation (A letter of commendation from an Admiral) for my superior technical ability demonstrated during the decommissioning of the SATCOM terminal.</p>

* After the SATCOM terminal was decommisioned, I was transferred to a new department where I became a Communications Watch Officer. With this role, I was in charge of monitoring and maintaining all communications circuits for the United States portion of the Naval Base in Rota Spain, as well as the secure communications for the embassy in Mardrid and the Air Base in Moron. I was in charge of a watch team of 4 - 5 people where I had to perform their yearly evaluations and mid-term counsellings. At the conclusion of my time in Spain, I was awarded the Navy Achievement medal for my achievements and accomplishments during my time at the command.</p>

* While on stationed aboard the HSV-2 Swift, I was regularly in charge of embarked technicans that were there to work on different systems on the boat. I was also made the temporary LPO (Leading Petty Officer) while the actual LPO was unavailable. This put me in chage of 12 people, 9 of which were higher ranking than myself. I was in charge of tasking the department from order given down by the officers on the boat and reporting the status back to them. I also had to routinely breif the Admiral in charge of the fleet as the the status of the systems onboard our ship as we were part of a high profile mission.</p>

* Within 1 week of being onboard the ship, we had an equipment casualty that led to us finding out about 90% of the communications circuits on the boat were not functioning. Within 2 weeks, with some outside help, I had all the communications circuits up and running. As part of this effort, I found numerous configuration issues that would need to be fixed through out the year. For this effort, I was awarded the Navy Achievement Medal for the second time.</p>
