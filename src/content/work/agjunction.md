Software Lead for the Polaris Project.  Polaris is the name for the project that will build the software and controls platform
for all future projects at Agjunction. The platform is a Yocto Linux based application platform where each process is run in a
docker container.</p>

As part of the Polaris Project, I oversaw the design and implementation of a docker based micro-services architecture on an
embedded device. As part of this effort, I led the creation and completion of software sprints. I was in charge of mapping out
a sprint schedule the would make sure the software team hit its goals for the year.</p>

Wrote a low-level driver for a Magnetometer to run on a microcontroller. The majority of the driver was written based on the
current code and the datasheet. This driver only required minimal integration and test time before the entire system was ready
to be tested on a tractor.</p>

Ported an existing feature, a special type of turn, from AgJunction's OEM product to their consumer product. This feature allows
the user to be able to automatically do a U-turn at the end of a pass on the field and begin a new pass with the implement behind
the tractor lined up perfectly with the previous pass, with no overlap. This feature makes the consumer product much more valuable
to Agjunction's customers.</p>

Updated production test software of one of AgJunction's products to be more configurable and flexible. The previous implementation
of the production test software had every parameter hardcoded. These hardcoded values no longer worked the configurations coming
from the factory. I made the hardcoded parameters flexible and made some changes to the software to make it easier to update version
numbers and server names to save time on maintenance in the future.</p>
