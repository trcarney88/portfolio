Booki is a mobile application built with Flutter with a Serverless Backend built in Python on AWS.
Firebase is used for Authentication and Authorization because of its seamless integration with
Flutter. I also use Firebase for analytics and ads to monetize the app. A serverless API is used to
handle data transfer from the application to the backend. This API runs on AWS and is built with the
Serverless Framework. I chose to use the Serverless Framework because it allows me to have the entire
backend represented as code via YAML files.

I decided to create Booki because I wanted to create a new way to play fantasy sports that didn't
require the time investment of current forms of the game. So instead of picking a line up where you
have to track the status of every team and player on your team, you just have to track the
performance of each team. The tagline for Booki is 'Real Games, Real Odds, Fake Money'

Booki is currently in Alpha testing. Push notifications need to be developed before we can move to
Beta Testing. Once Beta Testing in started, the plan is to implement the private and public leagues
with standings and intra-league messaging before we take the app live. The goal is to have the app
released by March 2022.

I am working to make this project a buisiness, therefore I am keeping the source code private.
